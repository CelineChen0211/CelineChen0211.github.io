<h2> <center>A quick look at this project</center> </h2>

<p>		What is the current demand in the job market? How much money can I make if I major in statistics? What are the most important skills to put into my resume? Where are the hiring companies located? How does the job market differ across different majors? When is the job market largest?â€¦ </p>

<p> 	These practical questions are faced by new graduates and even younger college students. This project tries its best to help the freshmen to choose the best major; senior and graduate students to draw a big picture of the current job market. </p>

<p> 	The majority of this project analyzes and compares the job market for the 3 majors of STAT, CHE, and MSE. (Because we are CHE and MSE students considering of pursuing a second degree!) </p>

<h2> METHOD & TECHENIQUES </h2>

<p>		The data of the job market come from indeed.com(link). We restricted our scope to STAT, CHE, and MSE, and California. (The procedure can be easily extended to other locations and majors.) </p>

<p>		To quickly get to the fun part of the results, the methodologies and techniques we used for this project are summarized in this table. You may scroll down to the very bottom to find the link to our jupyter notebook to find more details. </p>

<h2> Interesting Findings </h2>
	+ Where are the hiring companies
	<div>
  	<img src="JobMarket/Figures/LocationofJobs.png" height="300" align="right">
  </div>
	<p> Not surprisingly, there are two clusters on the map, one is at the silicon valley, and the other is around LA. </p>
	<p> Another interesting observation is that the STAT companies are more closely centered at these two locations, whereas the CHE and MSE companies are more widely distributed.</p>
