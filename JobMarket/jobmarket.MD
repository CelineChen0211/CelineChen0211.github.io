<h2> <center>A quick look at this project</center> </h2>

<p>		What is the current demand in the job market? How much money can I make if I major in statistics? What are the most important skills to put into my resume? Where are the hiring companies located? How does the job market differ across different majors? When is the job market largest?â€¦ </p>

<p> 	These practical questions are faced by new graduates and even younger college students. This project tries its best to help the freshmen to choose the best major; senior and graduate students to draw a big picture of the current job market. </p>

<p> 	The majority of this project analyzes and compares the job market for the 3 majors of STAT, CHE, and MSE. (Because we are CHE and MSE students considering of pursuing a second degree!) </p>

<h2> METHOD & TECHENIQUES </h2>

<p>		The data of the job market come from indeed.com(link). We restricted our scope to STAT, CHE, and MSE, and California. (The procedure can be easily extended to other locations and majors.) </p>

<p>		To quickly get to the fun part of the results, the methodologies and techniques we used for this project are summarized in this table. You may scroll down to the very bottom to find the link to our jupyter notebook to find more details. </p>

<h2> Interesting Findings </h2>
	<h3> Where are the hiring companies </h3>
	<div>
  	<img src="Figures/LocationofJobs.png" height="300" align="right">
  	</div>
	<p> Not surprisingly, there are two clusters on the map, one is at the silicon valley, and the other is around LA. </p>
	<p> Another interesting observation is that the STAT companies are more closely centered at these two locations, whereas the CHE and MSE companies are more widely distributed.</p>

	<h3> Grads vs Undergrads, who are more wanted? </h3>
	<div>
		<img src="Figures/Degree requirement comparison.png" height="200" align="middle">
	</div>
<p>The majority of the jobs only require a Bachelors degree. For internships, the percentage of graduate is slightly higher. It is interesting to find that there is really high demand for Materials Science graduate students for internships.</p>

	</div>
<p>The population data of the entire US in 2014 to 2015 academic year of the statistic major and engineering majors come from the National Center for Education Statistics. And the job demand data were obtained from Indeed website and only for California. Since the data are not on the same page in terms of time and locations, we only compared the percentage of different degrees. </p>
<p>Assuming the CA data is representative for the entire nation, the percentage of undergrad is smaller in population than that in the job market. It seems to be easier for undergrads to find a job. However, people with higher education levels may prefer to continue their career in academia rather than industry.</p>
