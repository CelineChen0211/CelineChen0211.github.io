  <p>
  Hi, I am Jiewei! Welcome to my website.</p>
  <p> 
  I am from Wuhan, China, a place along the Yangtze river, a place full of great food and a place where Yellow Crane Tower locates. In 2010, I left my hometown and entered Zhejiang University in Hang Zhou. I spent my most beautiful four years in this "Paradise City". Not to exaggerate Hangzhou can be called my second hometown. After the graduation from ZJU in 2014, I headed University of California, Davis to get my Ph.D degree. That is where I am now. =] 
  </p>
  <p> I love badminton, love singing, love life!
